# Featurfy-Spotify-Track-Analysis-
A Shiny web app that analyzes Spotify Artists and User Playlists

This app will allow the user to look up an album / playlist, and analyze all of their tracks in order to obtain an aggregate breakdown summary of their music in general. Potentially text mine the lyrics of all the songs to create a word cloud by relative frequency.
